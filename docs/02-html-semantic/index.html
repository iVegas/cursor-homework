    <h1>Human mission to Mars</h1>

    <p>A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction since the 1880s, and of aerospace engineering and
        scientific proposals since the late 1940s. Plans include landing on Mars for exploration at a minimum, with some
        considering exploring its moons Phobos and Deimos. Longterm proposals have included sending settlers and
        starting terraforming of the planet.</p>



    <h2>Exploration of Mars</h2>

    <p>The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades. Conceptual work for missions that
        would involve human explorers has been ongoing since the 1950s, with planned missions typically being stated as
        taking place anywhere between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.The list of crewed Mars mission
        plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies
        in this field of space exploration. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in which a small group
        (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or year, to a continuous
        presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization or other continuous humanization). Virtual visits to
        Mars, using haptic technologies, have also been proposed.</p>
    <p>In the 2010s, numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for human missions to
        Mars.[citation needed] In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic
        novels, and films.</p>
